# Filter
A program that applies 4 types of filters to BMPs

Try compiling filter for yourself by going to your terminal and running

$ make filter
Then, you can run the program by running:

$ ./filter -g images/yard.bmp out.bmp <br>
which takes the image at images/yard.bmp, and generates a new image called out.bmp after running the pixels through the grayscale function. grayscale doesnâ€™t do anything just yet, though, so the output image should look the same as the original yard. Instead of -g (grayscale), you can use -s, -r, -b for (sepia, reflect, and blur).

$ make recover <br>
$ ./recover card.raw <br>
